In today's digital age, where online transactions have become the norm, it's crucial to be vigilant and protect yourself from fraud. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new methods to try and swindle you of your hard-earned money. Don't worry, though — we've got your back with these tips to help you keep scammers at bay. 

## Dollarpesa **Will Never Request Your Personal Information Through SMS or a Call**

Fraudsters commonly impersonate legitimate businesses through SMS, email, or calls. For example, they might send you an SMS pretending to be your bank, requesting your account logins. Always remember that Dollarpesa will never ask for your personal information, such as your PIN or password, by SMS or email. Additionally, Dollarpesa will never send you an OTP through SMS. Instead, you will always receive it via the official Dollarpesa app.  

## **Beware of Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers**

We all love a good discount, and scammers know it. That's why they often try to reel you in with irresistible offers that appear too good to pass up. When you see an online post of an item that seems suspiciously cheap, think twice before buying it unless it’s from a reputable seller. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, chances are it is.  

## **Don’t Click That Link**

Avoid clicking links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Fraudsters use phishing techniques to try and trick you into clicking dubious links. Phishing is a type of scam where scammers attempt to steal your personal information by impersonating a reputable site you already use. Sometimes, they send links that carry trojans, viruses and other malicious programs that can attack your device. Instead of relying on email or social media links, navigate directly to the online store by typing the URL into your web browser. 

## **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi**

Many of us like to take advantage of the free Wi-Fi at public places like coffee shops, bars, restaurants and airports. But did you know that public Wi-Fi hotspots are risky and may give scammers easy access to your device? Sure, public Wi-Fi is convenient, but most networks are unsecured and easily enable fraudsters to access your personal data. Stay safe and use secure, password-protected networks or your cellular data network. 

## **Conclusion**

Scammers are always on the prowl, looking for their next unsuspecting victim. Don't make it easy for them; follow these essential tips and significantly reduce the risk of being defrauded. Stay informed, remain vigilant, and use trusted platforms like Dollarpesa for secure transactions.
