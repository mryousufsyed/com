## **Bottom Line: Is** Redotpay **card worth it?**

Redotpay **card is definitely not the best crypto card** in the market due to several reasons such as high staking requirements, top-up fees, poor card limits, and various other fees like inactivity fees, foreign currency transaction fees, ATM fees, etc.

Redotpay Visa card presents several considerations that might not appeal to every user. Firstly, staking CRO for a minimum of six months is mandatory to unlock card features. To unlock the maximum rewards and benefits of the Redotpay Card involves staking CRO of €350,000 for a period of 6 months.

Moreover, Changing card tiers resets the staking term, necessitating an additional six-month commitment. Reimbursements for streaming services are subject to conditions, including the need to pay with the Redotpay Visa card, and there’s a monthly reimbursement cap for various services.

The Redotpay card fees and limits are not appealing either. The “fee free” ATM limits are quite low even for the Obsidian Card, and incur a 2% charge after specific monthly limits, and various other fees apply, including reissue fees, top-up fees, and inactivity fees.
