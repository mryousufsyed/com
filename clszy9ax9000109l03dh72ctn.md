Certainly! Let‚Äôs delve into the differences between **virtual cards** and **physical credit cards**:

1. **Virtual Cards**:
    
    * A virtual card is a randomly generated card linked to your credit card account.
        
    * It has no corresponding physical card; it exists purely in the digital realm.
        
    * When you use a virtual card for online transactions, you avoid sharing your actual card number with stores.
        
    * Benefits:
        
        * **Added Security**: Virtual cards provide an extra layer of security by keeping your actual card number private online.
            
        * **Control**: You can easily lock and unlock virtual cards without affecting other spending.
            
        * **Store-Specific Cards**: Create dedicated virtual cards for different online stores, making checkout quicker.
            
    * How to get a virtual card for your Capital One credit card:
        
        * Use the **Capital One Mobile app** to access or generate virtual cards 24/7.
            
        * Download the **Eno browser extension** for desktop shopping; Eno generates virtual cards for online stores.
            
        * If you use **Google Pay** on Chrome or Android apps, eligible Capital One credit cards support virtual cards.
            
2. **Physical Cards**:
    
    * Widely accepted both online and offline.
        
    * Physical cards are tangible and can be used for in-person transactions.
        
    * Vulnerable to physical theft, skimming, and cyberattacks when used online.
        
    * Useful for purchases that require physical card verification (e.g., airline tickets or hotel reservations).
        

In summary, virtual cards offer convenience and added security for online shopping, while physical cards remain versatile for various situations. Choose wisely based on your needs! üåüüí≥
