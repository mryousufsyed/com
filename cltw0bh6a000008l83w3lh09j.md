## 16\. Questions about fees, commissions and payouts

**What is the fee for deposits by a bank wire?**  
Currently we do not charge a fee for deposits by a bank wire; however correspondent banks may charge you for their services. You should also consider fees paid to Certified Exchange Service providers (primary or secondary ones).  
  
  
**What is the fee for withdrawals by a bank?**  
Currently the fee is $50 + 3% of the total amount (but no more than $1,000). The commission is paid from the balance of the sender\`s account. You can always view our current commission fees in the ‚ÄúFees‚Äù section. You should also take into account fees set by each individual Certified Exchange Service provider (primary or additional) you select.  
  
  
**What is the fee for a transfer to another account within the system?**  
The commission for internal payments is 0.5% of the amount transferred for verified accounts and premium accounts. For unverified accounts the commission is 1.99%. It is always paid from the balance of the sender\`s account.  
  
  
**How does the system calculate the annual 4 interest rate?**  
At the end of each month the system calculates 0.33% of your minimum account balance. For example, if your account balance was going up or down during one month but its minimum value was $1000.00, you will be credited with $3.30 at the end of that month.  
  

## 17\. Credit Exchange

**What is the Credit Exchange?**  
The Credit Exchange is a service offered by the Perfect Money system to its users who wish to borrow or lend money at an interest and on mutually beneficial terms. More information on how to get or issue a loan, visit the ‚ÄúCredit Exchange‚Äù section at¬† [https://perfectmoney.is/credits/about.html.  
  
  
**Is**](https://perfectmoney.is/credits/about.html.ÔøºÔøºÔøºIs) **there a fee for participating in the Credit Exchange?**  
The Credit Exchange does not charge any additional fees. A lender pays the standard 0.5% fee upon request to transfer money to a borrower. A borrower also pays the standard 0.5% fee upon request to transfer money to the lender. Please note that the fee for unverified accounts equals 1.99%.  
  
  
**In which currencies are loans offered?**  
All operations on the Credit Exchange are carried out in USD and Euros.  
  
  
**How do I become a lender on the Perfect Money Credit Exchange?**  
If you want to become a lender, you need to create a loan proposal. To start a loan proposal, you need to go to the Credit Exchange and click "Give a loan".  
  
Fill is your loan offer by specifying the account you want to use, the amount proposed for a loan, the interest rate, the loan term, a way of loan processing, the loan purpose and the comment. Once you are done, click on the ‚ÄòPreview‚Äô button and check all the information entered. If you are sure that everything is correct, click on "Create a new loan proposal" to confirm, or on the "Back" button to make any corrections.  
  
Your loan proposal will be added to the existing list of proposals - https://perfectmoney.is/credits/deals\_give.html  
  
  
  
**Is the lending process automatic or manual?**  
It all depends on a lender and his/her terms. You can set it up as automatic or manual, and even give a personal loan.  
  
  
**What is a personal loan?**  
A lender can make a personal loan offer to a particular agent, usually selected from the list of trusted agents. The process of issuing a personal loan is similar to a regular one. All you need to do is to select ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù from the "Deal process" options. In the popped up field you need to specify the name of the agent you are issuing the personal loan to. The rest of the procedure remains the same.  
  
  
**What happens if a borrower fails to repay a loan on time?**  
If a borrower fails to repay a loan, the system will automatically block his/her account and its balance will be used to pay off the loan.  
  
  
**How do I protect myself from dishonest borrowers?**  
You can screen borrowers by looking at their reliability rating or Trust Score: the higher, the better. A lender has a right to set lower limits for Trust Score rankings for loan receivers. A lender also has a right to choose who to issue loans to or to deny applications. Please ask the borrower to disclose all information about his account and analyze the information carefully. Generally you can, and should, ask as much information as necessary to rest assured that the loan will be returned.  
  
You can create your own list of agents to work with.  
  
  
  
**What is the minimum and maximum loan term?**  
The minimum loan term is 1 day. The maximum loan term is 365 days.  
  
  
**What is the minimum and maximum interest rate for loans?**  
The minimum interest rate is 0.5%. The maximum interest rate is 200%. However, you should remember that the smaller is your interest rate, the higher is your chance to attract users and to receive a good feedback.  
  
  
**How do I borrow money?**  
To obtain a loan you need to create a loan application or to look through a list of existing loan proposals; you might find the one you like. If you fail to find an offer that meets your needs, you can create your own loan application.  
  
To create your own application, you need to go to the ‚ÄúCredit Exchange‚Äù section and click ‚ÄúGet a loan‚Äù.  
  
On the opened page please specify the account in which you want to receive your loan, the requested amount, the interest rate, the loan term, purpose of the loan and the comment. Once you are done, click on the ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù button and check all the information entered. If you are sure that everything is correct, click on "Create a new loan application" to confirm, or on the "Back" button to make any corrections.  
  
After it is created, your application will be listed here https://perfectmoney.is/credits/deals\_take.html  
  
  
  
**What shall I do if I do not want everyone to see my loan application?**  
You need to create a regular application. However, you need to type the account number of a specific agent in the field marked "For agent", or choose an agent(s) from your list. Your request will be sent directly to the specified person, and no one else will see it.  
  
  
**What is a Trust Score and how is it calculated?**  
Trust Score is a personal rating of each member on the Perfect Money Credit Exchange, which characterizes business activity of its owner.  
  
Calculation of the Trust Score is based on the following:  
  
a. Productivity ‚Äì the number of accounts involved in transactions;  
b. Volume ‚Äì the amount of funds transferred;  
c. Lifetime ‚Äì the age of the account (starting from the first transaction);  
d. Reviews - complaints and positive feedback on the account;  
e. Amount ‚Äì the monthly minimum account balance  
  
The minimum Trust Score value is 0. There is no limit for the maximum Trust Score. All new accounts have a Trust Score of 0.  
  
  
**What does a medal in my account mean?**  
For users with a long lifetime in Perfect Money system we give medals for loyalty. The medals are the hallmark of the account showing the rating and the status of the user\`s account. There are 3 types of medals - bronze, silver, and gold, corresponding to 3 different levels. The key factor in the medal award procedure is the lifetime of the account.  
  
**Can I get a gold or platinum medal by paying a certain amount?**  
No, you cannot. These medals are free of charge and are awarded based on active use and loyalty to the service.  
  
**Can the system change the class of medal by replacing it with the lower ranked one, for example, from gold to silver?**  
No, it is impossible.  
  
**Why is my Trust Score not growing?**  
It is possible that the amount of transactions you make is not enough to increase your Trust Score. Operations within your account might be small and identical for your Trust Score to grow. Increase your productivity, ask your former Credit Exchange partners to leave positive feedback, and your ranking will begin to rise. Try not to engage in conflict with other participants of the Credit Exchange as negative feedback can significantly harm your reputation.  
  
**Why does my Trust Score fall?**  
It can happen due to a decrease in your account performance or in your general turnover.  
  
It will be difficult to increase your Trust Score by making identical transactions or using similar tactics. Please keep in mind that a high Trust Score at the moment does not guarantee better results in the future.  
  
You should also maintain active communication with your borrowers to avoid misunderstanding and negative reviews that can affect your Trust Score.  
  
  
**How can I provide an access to my personal data for the Credit Exchange users?**  
You need to go to the "Settings" section, and place a check mark against those items that you want to make public. You can share your turnover, transaction history and deals. Save your choices by clicking ‚ÄúSave‚Äù. No further action is required.  
  
**Why would I need to make my personal information visible for other Credit Exchange users?**  
Other Credit Exchange users only see your account number and your credit rating by default. If you make your personal information public, users‚Äô trust in you will grow significantly, which, in turn, will result in a greater number of mutually beneficial operations.  
  
**How can I configure notifications on my Credit Exchange transactions?**  
You can choose to receive notifications about transactions made on the Credit Exchange. Enable notifications to your e-mail address or mobile phone number (entered in an international format).  
  
First, go to "Settings" and click "Change notification settings". If you haven‚Äôt done that already or would like to make changes, enter your e-mail address and telephone number. Then select the events you want to get notified about and a way to receive notifications. Save your settings.  
  
**How much will it cost to stay notified?**  
If you select SMS-notifications, each SMS message sent to your mobile phone will cost you 10 cents deducted from your main USD account balance. E-mail notifications are free of charge.
