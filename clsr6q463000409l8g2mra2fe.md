A lot of people that have been in the digital currency sector prior to the bitcoin boom of 2017 would likely be more acquainted with Perfect Money than others who joined after. But in case you are just hearing about Perfect Money, and you are curious to understand how it works, and how to use it to buy/sell bitcoin in Egypt, then you have come to the right place.

## **What is Perfect Money?**

Perfect money was launched in 2007, two years before the launch of bitcoin. Although the launch happened in Panama, the headquarters of perfect money was later relocated to Zurich, switzerland.

Perfect Money is an electronic or online payment system that allows customers to send Money without any country restrictions. This may not look like a big deal now that people easily send crypto to their friends and family within few minutes and then can convert to their local currency in any part of the world, but before crypto became mainstream, this was not the case. A lot of people had to depend on bank transfers and other traditional money transfer platforms, and the processes were either stressful, costly or both.

Since its launch in 2007, it has gained popularity worldwide for its versatility, security, and anonymity at a time when most of its other competitors like liberty reserve were facing issues of fraud. Perfect money operates as a digital currency and e-wallet that allows users to make instant payments and money transfers securely using the internet. The Perfect Money platform does not only act as an online wallet, but they also offer a range of services including currency exchange, e-commerce payment processing, and money transfers between users.

## **Features of Perfect Money**

**Security:** One of the primary advantages that users of Perfect Money cite for their choice is its security features. The platform uses advanced encryption algorithms to protect users' accounts and transactions from unauthorized access or fraud. It also offers two-factor authentication, which provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to enter a unique code sent to their mobile phone or email address in order to access their account(remember that this kind of authentication wasnt common as at 2007 ðŸ™‚). This made it an ideal choice for users who value the privacy and security of their transactions.

**Multiple currency wallet:** Another advantage that Perfect Money has over its predeccesors is its versatility. Users can hold balances in a variety of currencies, including USD, EUR, and Bitcoin. They can also exchange Perfect Money for other digital currencies or traditional currencies like USD or EUR. This made it a popular choice among users who engage in online shopping or trading, as it allowed them to easily transfer funds between different platforms and accounts.

**Versatility:** Perfect Money also offers a variety of tools and features to help users manage their finances. For example, users can set up automatic payments, view their transaction history, and generate detailed reports on their account activity. They can also create multiple wallets within their account, which can be useful for organizing funds and keeping track of different balances.

**Global acceptance:** Perfect money can be used for transactions online, from anywhere. The fact that users can also easily convert from one national currency to another has also made it easy for international merchants to consider this as an acceptable payment method. The only areas where there might be restriction in the use of perfect money would be in areas where there is a blanket ban on all digital currency transaction.

However, it's worth noting that not all platforms support Perfect Money as a payment method, because they may not have sufficient local liquidity.
