The duration for a transaction to be completed on **DollarPesa** depends on several factors, including the specific cryptocurrency being transacted, network congestion, and the chosen transaction fee. Letâ€™s break it down:

1. **Cryptocurrency Type**: Different cryptocurrencies have varying confirmation times. For instance:
    
    * **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Typically takes around **10 minutes** for the first confirmation, but itâ€™s advisable to wait for more confirmations for larger transactions.
        
    * **Ethereum (ETH)**: Usually faster, with confirmations within **1-2 minutes**.
        
    * **Litecoin (LTC)**: Also relatively quick, with confirmations in a few minutes.
        
2. **Network Congestion**: During times of high demand, such as market rallies or significant events, the network can become congested. In such cases, transaction processing may take longer.
    
3. **Transaction Fee**: The transaction fee you choose affects the priority of your transaction. Higher fees result in faster processing. Conversely, lower fees may lead to delays.
    
4. **Blockchain Confirmations**: Most exchanges and wallets require a certain number of confirmations on the blockchain before considering a transaction complete. Each confirmation adds to the overall time.
    
5. **Security Measures**: Some platforms implement additional security checks, which can extend the processing time.
    

In summary, for a basic transaction, you can expect anywhere from a few minutes to around 30 minutes. However, itâ€™s essential to check the specific details on DollarPesaâ€™s platform and monitor the transaction status. Remember that cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, so patience and attention to detail are crucial! ðŸ•’ðŸ’Ž
