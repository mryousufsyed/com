## **Payeer Services**

[Payeer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.payeer&hl=en&gl=US) offers the services to make and receive payments in many countries with several options. It also supports many online currency exchange services and lets its users operate on different systems, bank cards, and institutions. You can sign-up with the service just by entering your email ID, a verification code sent to your email, and your name and country. Payeer lets users register an unverified account with a daily withdrawal limit of 999 USD. 

The service offers to order a free MasterCard debit card (plastic as well as virtual). 

However, the issuance of new MasterCards is suspended currently, and previously issued cards are blocked too. Therefore, you are not able to use the Payeer MasterCard at all. 

Payeer supports the investment and trading of cryptocurrencies and allows users to buy these currencies by depositing funds in USD, EUR, and RUB. If you already hold a Payeer-supported cryptocurrency, you can use it to fund your account. It also supports seven types of cryptocurrencies, AdvCash, and Perfect Money for funds transfer.

## **Is Payeer Safe?**

Payeer offers its financial services in the EU through Financa Private Limited Company. It has received its activity license Virtual Currency Service from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (MEAC) Estonia. It means that Payeer is a reliable processor, and your funds are safe with them.

Payeer has received an average score on various user review platforms. The main concern of the users is the problem of withdrawing their funds. Many users had complained that they were unable to withdraw funds via Visa/MasterCard. Another issue is that Payeer is currently not issuing new MasterCards for all countries, and the previously issued MasterCards have been blocked too. 

Payeer is safe and legit, but its withdrawal option has annoyed many users.
