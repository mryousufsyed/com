Understanding these factors can help you make sense of the exchange rates you come across. Keep an eye on relevant news and market trends to gain a better understanding of where exchange rates might be heading. This will allow you to make informed decisions and avoid any nasty surprises.

Be sure to check the fee structure on DollarPesa Exchange or any other platform you're using. Some platforms charge a percentage fee, while others may have a flat fee.
