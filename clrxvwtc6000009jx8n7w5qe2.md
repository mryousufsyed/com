Facebook ads are the best way to get your business in front of potential customers. They're affordable, easy to set up and measure, and can be targeted to only show up in the feeds of users who might actually find you interesting. If you’re wondering whether to go with **Facebook ads vs Bing ads** or any other platform, read on. In this post, we'll go over the top five reasons why you need Facebook ads to take your business to the next level.

## **Facebook Ads Allow You to Target Your Audience**

You can target by **demographics, interests and behaviours**. You can also target by location, device and age, gender and relationship status. You can even narrow down the audience based on income level or education level.

Facebook keeps track of everything people do on their platform; every post they read, video they watch and comment they leave. So, if someone has been browsing around for information about what kind of car they want to buy, you could use **Facebook's targeting capabilities to show them an ad highlighting all the great features** that make this particular model stand out from its competitors. When they click on it and visit your website/landing page, chances are good that they’ll convert into a sale because they were already interested in buying something similar.

## **Access to a Massive Customer Base**

Facebook ads give you access to a massive customer base. Facebook has **1.49 billion daily active users and 2.19 billion monthly active users**, making it the largest social network in the world. The platform also boasts 2.37 billion monthly active mobile users, which means that if your target audience is on Facebook, they're likely using their mobile device to engage with it (and therefore more likely to see your ad).

## **Facebook Ads are Affordable**

You can set a budget for your campaign, and it's up to you **how much money you want to spend.** You can also choose what type of budgeting method works best for you: daily or lifetime budgets, CPC (cost per click), CPM (cost per thousand impressions) and CPA (cost per action).

## **You can Laser-focus Your Message**

Facebook ads are a great way to target your audience. You can choose who will see your ad by things like age, gender and location. So that if you run **Facebook ads in Dubai**, your ads will only be displayed to those people who live in your Country. These ads also allow you to focus on specific interests that people have listed in their profiles (like if they like a certain band or sports team). The majority of businesses find this targeting very useful because it allows them to **reach people who are most likely intereste**d in what they have to offer.

## **You Can Measure Performance**

As the saying goes, "you can't improve what you don't measure." With Facebook ads, there are a few ways you can measure your campaign performance. The first step is to **set up conversion tracking.** This lets you see how many people who saw your ad converted into a sale or lead (i.e., completed an action). You should also track engagement metrics like clicks and impressions to help you determine which posts or ad copy is working best for each audience segment.

## **The Bottom Line**

Facebook ads are a great way to reach your target audience and get them interested in what you have to offer. The platform has millions of users, so it's easy for you to find people who are interested in what you have to say. Plus, Facebook ads are **affordable and easy to set up;** you can create one in minutes! If you're not using this tool yet, now is the time: it could help take your business from good to great.
