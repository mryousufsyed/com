### **Why Webmoney?**

WebMoney is an online payment system and a comprehensive tool for online business operations. It was originally developed as a money transfer system for US dollars in Russia in 1998 and since then, nearly 40 million people from all over the globe have joined the program.

WebMoney provides digital currency purses that can hold popular national currencies. The payment platform provides a P2P credit purse, global payment solutions, retail services, local payment products, online billing, and direct integration with other global financial service providers. On top of that, a number of countries worldwide are currently working on WebMoney and consumers pay WebMoney for the services of different companies from Spain, Poland, and Belgium.

Essentially, you can trace back a lot of the crypto and DeFi ideas back to WM. In that regard, it is more of an effort to circumvent unnecessary banking regulations. A decade before Bitcoin, WM was one of the few payment systems independent of banking. DollarPesa is All You Need!
