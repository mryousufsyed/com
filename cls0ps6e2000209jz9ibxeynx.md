The creators of DollarPesa recognized the challenges faced by individuals and businesses in Bangladesh when it comes to currency exchange.

Before DollarPesa came along, currency exchange in Bangladesh posed significant challenges. Let's explore some of the major issues individuals and businesses faced.

In addition to limited access, traditional currency exchange services were notorious for their high fees and less-than-ideal exchange rates. These costs ate into people's budgets, making foreign transactions more expensive than necessary.  
  

### 2.3 Lack of Transparency and Security

  
  
Another area of concern was the lack of transparency and security in traditional currency exchange. People often had to rely on word of mouth or recommendations to find trusted services. This lack of transparency made it difficult to know if they were getting fair deals or if their transactions were secure.
