2. For the purposes hereof "Exchange" shall mean an exchange of the crypto asset of one type to the crypto asset of another type at the terms and conditions set forth by exchanging parties, which is executed via the Third-party service in respective block-chain network. When you exchange crypto assets you acknowledge and agree that the Exchange will be processed through the third-party exchange service with additional fees applicable to such Exchange. You acknowledge and agree that the exchange rates information made available via the Services are an estimation only and may differ from prevailing rates available via other sources outside of our Services.
    
3. "Crypto Assets" herein shall be deemed as type of assets which can only and exclusively be transmitted by means of block-chain technology, including but not limited to digital coins and digital tokens and any other type of digital mediums of exchange, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc, to the full and absolute exempt of the securities of any kind.
    
4. “Marketplace” herein shall mean an online digital aggregation platform for fiat providers with an option to compare current rates and limits for buying or selling crypto assets.
    
5. To be able to use all possibilities and functionality of our Services you shall go through the registration process and create a Dollarpesa Account. "Dollarpesa Account" is a user account accessible after the registration process and via the Services where the user may request to make a crypto assets exchange. User should manage and maintain only one Dollarpesa Account. Users are prohibited from creating multiple accounts. When you create a Dollarpesa Account you oblige to:
    
    1. change the password, which is generated by our Services automatically, for a strong password that you do not use for any other websites, online or off-line services;
        
    2. provide accurate e-mail, which actually belongs to you and shall be, therefore, verified. The access to the services provided by the Dollarpesa without verification of the e-mail is not allowed;
        
    3. maintain the security of your Dollarpesa Account and promptly notify us if you discover any suspicious activity related to your account;
        
    4. agree to receive emails containing information about credentials, passwords, transactions and marketing promotions;
        
    5. agree to pass through AML/KYC procedures, which may be applied to You according to our internal AML/KYC policies. As a part of such procedures, Dollarpesa reserves the right to request additional information and documents, which are aimed without limitation to identify our user and to prove the source of the funds;
        
    6. take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Dollarpesa Account.
        
        The "Floating exchange rate" option herein shall mean an exchange rate mode in which our platform does not guarantee the rate - so it fluctuates in accordance with the market. You acknowledge and agree that the exchange rate information made available via Services for the Floating exchange rate option is an estimation only and may differ from the actual rates available via other sources outside of our Services. Dollarpesa cannot guarantee the execution of a Floating exchange rate transaction in some cases, including, but not limited to the following ones:
        
        1. user sent crypto assets to a previously used one-time address that had been generated for a Floating exchange rate transaction;
            
        2. user sent an amount of crypto assets different from the amount to be sent that was displayed on the Website, or did not account for the relevant withdrawal and network fees, thus sending an amount that is too small;
            
        3. the user sent crypto assets to a Dollarpesa floating-rate address later than in 3 hours after the address was provided. Dollarpesa floating rate addresses cannot be used after the 3 hour mark.
            
        4. in order to avoid any substantial losses for the customer caused by the rate change, when a significant disparity between an estimated exchange rate available on the Website and the rate received from a third-party exchange arises, a Floating exchange rate transaction may be failed automatically.
            
        
        If despite the aforementioned cases the market situation allows us to make the exchange, the transaction will be exchanged manually at the new rate.  
        If the market situation is such that the transaction cannot be executed anymore, or if the rate has changed significantly and the user asks for a refund, the crypto assets that the user wants to exchange will be refunded, if at all possible, less all applicable fees. The refund usually takes 1-7 business days (depending on the reason of the failure) after the users confirms their refund address.
        
6. When using the "Fixed exchange rate" option, your rate gets "locked" for fifteen or twenty minutes, meaning it remains the same irrespective of the changes on the market. You acknowledge and agree that for the Fixed exchange rate option the exchange rate information available on the Website may be different from the exchange rates for the Floating exchange rate option. Dollarpesa cannot guarantee the execution of a Fixed exchange rate transaction in some cases, including, but not limited to the following ones:
    
    1. user sent crypto assets more than 15 minutes (20 minutes in case of BTC, LTC, USDT, BNB, BUSD, ETH, DOGE) after clicking the “confirm & make payment” button when exchanging via the Fixed exchange rate option;
        
    2. user sent an amount of crypto assets different from the amount to be sent that was displayed on the Website, or did not account for the relevant withdrawal and network fees, thus sending an amount that is too small;
        
    3. user sent crypto assets to a previously used one-time address that had been generated for a Fixed exchange rate transaction.
        
    
    If the market situation allows us to make the exchange, the transaction will be pushed through manually at the rate that was confirmed by the customer at the beginning of the exchange.  
    If the market situation is such that the transaction cannot be executed anymore, the crypto assets that the user wants to exchange will be refunded, if at all possible, less all applicable fees ( applicable only to 2.7.1 and 2.7.2 cases).  
    Dollarpesa will be able to return the crypto assets to the user. The crypto assets will be sent manually from an exchange market we work with, less all applicable fees. A refund in such case usually takes up to 30 business days (applicable only to 2.7.3 case).
    
7. In order to perform the Exchange via our Services, our system will automatically generate a particular address for the initiated transaction, which contains information about **(i)** the user; **(ii)** the crypto asset that user wants to exchange and the crypto asset that user wants to receive (jointly - "crypto pair"); and **(iii)** the recipient address provided by the user (the address where exchanged crypto assets will be deposited). The user understands that the crypto assets to be exchanged are transferred only to the particular address provided by the system. The address is active only for one transaction and particularly, the one designated by the system.
    
8. The technical issues arising from your misuse of our services, such as creating incorrect transactions (entering a wrong address both when indicating the recipient address and when sending your crypto assets to us), and other types of user mistakes may be resolved by our technical department with limitations. Upon successful resolution of a technical issue, the crypto assets sent incorrectly will be refunded to the user, less all applicable fees.
    
    1. Dollarpesa technical department is able to refund only BTC from the Segwit BTC address. No other crypto assets, including but not limited to, LTC, BSV, BCH sent to a Segwit BTC address could be refunded;
        
    2. No crypto assets sent to us via an unsupported and/or not recommended network (e.g. BSC network) can be refunded. Recommended networks will be displayed to you during the transaction process.
        
9. You acknowledge and agree that any refund may cause operating costs for the allocated resources required for resolving user issues arising from misuse of our services. Dollarpesa shall be entitled to recover its operating costs for the services while executing any refund. In this case crypto assets will be refunded to the user, subtracting operating costs and network fees, only with a prior user’s consent.
    
10. YOU INDEMNIFY AND HOLD DOLLARPESA HARMLESS AGAINST ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INCORRECT USE OF ADDRESS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS ETC.
    
11. Dollarpesa does not provide custodial services, which means, we do not store your crypto assets on deposits and balances. In limited cases such as e.g. necessity to carry out AML/KYC procedure, your Exchange may be delayed. YOU HEREBY UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT ANY DELAYS ARE POSSIBLE; YOU INDEMNIFY AND HOLD US HARMLESS AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE EXCHANGE DELAY, WHETHER ORIGINATED FROM OUR FAULT OR NOT.
    
12. Dollarpesa is neither the creator, nor the administrator of any fiat provider at Marketplace. Therefore Dollarpesa is not responsible for providing, setting or controlling the fees applicable to any of the services or products which you find and use via our Marketplace. It merely acts as an aggregator landing platform for the various fiat providers integrating APIs of those providers. All fiat trading capabilities and services take place in accordance with and are subject to the policies and terms of use of the said fiat provider.
    

## 3. Fees

Dollarpesa keeps its fee policy transparent. The current fee structure is two-layered and is comprised of exchange and network fees.

1. 1. The exchange fee is the amount charged by Dollarpesa for executing transactions initiated by the users. The exchange fee structure depends on the transaction type: the Floating exchange rate or the Fixed one. The Floating exchange rate transactions incur a 0.25% fee from the output amount (it differs for transactions executed through our API partners). As with regard to the Fixed exchange rate transactions, Dollarpesa finds the best rate available on the market and fixes it for the conversion in question; the respective rate is displayed to the user, thus guaranteeing the protection of users’ funds from market fluctuations during the exchange.
        
    2. The network fee is paid to cryptocurrency miners for processing transactions in the network, and it serves to ensure withdrawals of the funds from exchanges. Dollarpesa collects and transfers these payments to respective exchanges, which themselves set the amount of the fee at any particular time. The moment a transaction is created, this fee is displayed to the user, with the amount being based on our estimates. With that, you acknowledge and agree that the final amount of the network fee charged can sometimes differ from our estimate. This occurs entirely due to the volatile nature of network fees prevalent on exchanges and does not depend on our platform in any respect.
        

## 4. AML and KYC Procedure

1. In furtherance of the clause 2.5.5 Dollarpesa reserves the right to apply the AML/KYC procedure to particular users, addresses and particular transactions of crypto assets.
    
2. The up-to-date information on the AML/KYC procedures can always be found at [AML/KYC](https://dollarpesa.com/aml-kyc-policy/).
